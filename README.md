# Founds-Center
A lightwidth finance program based on SAP

My name is Netanel, this is a personal project for fun, I made it public so people can use it when it's finished.

To do:
1. Improve UI functions.
2. Add the panel for the finance options
3. Connet the project to sql or cloud
4. Look into more transaction to add
5. Add login window and sql database for users
6. Add permissions for users and admin functionality
7. Add excel export option for data
8. Connect the data(cloud\sql) to the software

More will be added later..
